Clearing
An empty clearing in a forest. The place looks very much serene as the trees sway 
amongst the gentle breeze. No sounds could be heard asides the calming chirps of 
distant birds as the ever so silence shrouds the forest.

Overhead, the sun is bright over the zenith although much of the sunlight has been
dissipated by the hanging branches leaving only small traces of light reaching the
forest floor.

Around you, there is no life to be found yet the presence of a paved path leading 
into the trees catches your very eyes. Although faded into the ground, the sight of 
old footprints could still be seen along the path leading somewhere.

You see nowhere else to go and perhaps your only choice is to travel the mysterious 
path but perhaps you should stick around for a bit first. You certainly do not want
to wander off empty-handed and who knows what you might find around here...
